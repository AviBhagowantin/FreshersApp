# Mapwize.js

This is the Mapwize Javascript SDK. 

The SDK allows you to:

- Display the map of buildings, with all floors and places.
- Add your own data on the map.
- Locate the user inside the building.
- Display directions between 2 points, across multiple floors.

## Access to the platform

To get your access to the platform (API and back-end interface), sign up at [mapwize.io](https://www.mapwize.io)

Registration is required before you can use the SDK. But it's free!

## Mapbox plugin

The SDK is built as a [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js) plugin 
so you can take advantage of all the powerful features provided by Mapbox for data visualization.
 
Mapbox GL JS is included in the package so you don't have to worry about importing it. Mapwize.js is all you need.

The package is exposed as `Mapwize`.

## Documentation

The complete SDK documentation can be found at [docs.mapwize.io](https://docs.mapwize.io).
